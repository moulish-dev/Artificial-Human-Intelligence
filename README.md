## Abstract

Artificial Human Intelligence (AHI) presents a novel paradigm for achieving Artificial General Intelligence through human-centric cognitive development. Unlike traditional AI systems that focus on task-specific optimization, AHI proposes replicating the full spectrum of human intelligence by mimicking biological and developmental processes from birth.

This framework addresses critical limitations in current AI systems including lack of interpretability, poor generalization, and ethical misalignment. The proposed architecture incorporates embodied learning, emotional intelligence integration, continuous adaptation, and developmental stages that mirror human cognitive growth.

## Key Contributions

- 🧠 **Modular Architecture**: Comprehensive system spanning sensory input, perception, memory, decision-making, and behavioral output
- 🎯 **Human-Centric Development**: Developmental timeline progressing from basic sensory understanding to complex reasoning
- 🔄 **Continuous Learning**: No static training phases - lifelong adaptation through experience
- 🤝 **Ethical Alignment**: Natural alignment with human values through human-inspired cognitive architecture
- 🔍 **Interpretability**: Transparent behavior models based on human developmental stages

## Framework Overview

### Core Principles

1. **Embodied Behavior**: Physical or virtual embodiment enabling spatial awareness and environmental interaction
2. **Emotional Intelligence**: Recognition, interpretation, and response to human emotions
3. **Real-Time Perception**: Continuous environmental processing through vision, hearing, and touch
4. **Contextual Memory**: Integration of short-term and long-term memory using graph-connected structures
5. **Continuous Learning**: Dynamic updates through interactions, feedback, and real-world experiences

## AHI vs Traditional AI

| Feature | Traditional AI | AHI |
|---------|---------------|-----|
| Learning Mechanism | Pretrained/Static | Lifelong/Interactive |
| Human Mimicry | Rare/Superficial | Core Mechanism |
| Emotional Modeling | Minimal/Absent | Integrated |
| Context Awareness | Limited | Real-time Contextual |
| Interpretability | Low (Black Box) | High (Human-like) |
| Embodiment | Mostly Disembodied | Fully Embodied |

## Research Implications

This work proposes that achieving AGI requires more than statistical optimization - it demands replicating the fundamental aspects of human cognitive development. By treating intelligence as an embodied, interactive process that develops through experience, AHI offers a pathway toward:

- More interpretable AI systems
- Natural ethical alignment
- Improved generalization capabilities
- Enhanced human-AI collaboration

## Future Work

- [ ] Empirical validation through prototype development
- [ ] Benchmark creation for developmental learning assessment
- [ ] Integration with existing cognitive architectures
- [ ] Real-world embodied implementation studies
- [ ] Ethical framework development for human-like AI

*"The journey to AGI should not be about creating something alien to human understanding, but about replicating the most successful intelligence system we know - the human mind."*
